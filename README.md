# w5project-burger-tracker

This is a coding project after 4 weeks learning Ruby from scratch.  The major learning point
/ achievement was the code around the CRUD database actions, which I tried to make generic to avoid too much code duplication. 
I've subsequently learned this amounts to re-inventing a basic Object-Relational-Mapper (ORM), but at the time I didn't know 
what that was.

## Burger Tracker

Steven has an insatiable hunger for burgers. However, he only has a limited budget, so prefers to go to places that have a deal on. He would like a way to track which deals are available at which places on a given day so that he can maximise his burger intake for minimum spending.

## MVP:

Add a burger eatery
Add burgers available at an eatery and view them as a list
Add a list of deals for an eatery where a deal has
Label string e.g. "Two For One Tuesdays"
A list of burgers that deal applies to
The day that the deal is available on e.g. "Wednesday"

### Possible Extensions:

Show the deals available by day of the week Mon - Sun
Add a price to a burger and add a savings amount/percentage to a deal so it's clear how much Steven is saving
Any other ideas you might come up with
